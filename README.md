# Event Sourcing E-Commerce Application

## Overview
This project is an event-sourcing-based e-commerce application built using Kotlin, Spring Boot, and Axon Framework. It supports managing products, carts, and orders with event-sourcing principles.

## Features
- **Event Sourcing**: Uses Axon Framework for command and event handling.
- **REST API**: Endpoints for managing products and carts.
- **CSV Data Integration**: Load product data from CSV files.
- **Inventory Management**: Track and update product stock.
- **Testing**: Includes unit and integration tests.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 19
- Maven
- PostgreSQL

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the application:
   ```
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### Loading CSV Data
To load product data from a CSV file, use the `CsvDataLoader` service. Example:
```kotlin
val csvDataLoader = CsvDataLoader(commandGateway)
csvDataLoader.loadCsvData("path/to/csv/file.csv")
```

### API Endpoints
#### Products
- **Add Product**: `POST /products`
- **Update Stock**: `PUT /products/{productId}/stock`

#### Carts
- **Add Item to Cart**: `POST /additem/{aggregateId}`

## Testing
Run the tests using:
```bash
./mvnw test
```

## Performance Testing
Use the Kaggle cosmetics dataset to simulate real-world scenarios and measure performance.

### Monitoring

The application includes monitoring capabilities using Spring Boot Actuator. Actuator provides various endpoints to monitor and manage the application.

#### Enabling Actuator
1. Ensure the application is running.
2. Access the Actuator endpoints at `http://localhost:8080/actuator`.

#### Key Endpoints
- `/actuator/health`: Check the health status of the application.
- `/actuator/metrics`: View application metrics.
- `/actuator/httptrace`: Trace HTTP requests.

#### Customization
You can customize the Actuator settings in `application.yml` under the `management` section.

### Swagger UI

The application includes Swagger UI for testing and exploring the REST API endpoints.

#### Accessing Swagger UI
1. Start the application.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
3. Use the interface to test the available API endpoints.

#### Example Endpoints
- **Add Product**: `POST /products`
- **Update Stock**: `PUT /products/{productId}/stock`
- **Add Item to Cart**: `POST /additem/{aggregateId}`

Swagger UI provides a user-friendly way to interact with the API without needing external tools like Postman.
