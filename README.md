# üöÄ Event Sourcing E-Commerce Application

## üìñ Overview
This project is an event-sourcing-based e-commerce application built using Kotlin, Spring Boot, and Axon Framework. It supports managing products, carts, and orders with event-sourcing principles.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Event Sourcing**: Uses Axon Framework for command and event handling.
- **REST API**: Endpoints for managing products and carts.
- **CSV Data Integration**: Load product data from CSV files.
- **Inventory Management**: Track and update product stock.
- **Testing**: Includes unit and integration tests.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with Spring Boot Actuator for application health and metrics.
- **Swagger UI**: Interactive API documentation and testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 19
- Maven
- PostgreSQL

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### Loading CSV Data
To load product data from a CSV file, use the `CsvDataLoader` service. Example:
```kotlin
val csvDataLoader = CsvDataLoader(commandGateway)
csvDataLoader.loadCsvData("path/to/csv/file.csv")
```

### Importing Kaggle CSV Data

The application supports importing Kaggle CSV data into the database. The CSV file should have the following structure:

| Column         | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| event_time     | Timestamp of the event              |
| event_type     | Type of event (e.g., cart, view)    |
| product_id     | Unique identifier for the product   |
| category_id    | Identifier for the product category |
| category_code  | Code for the product category       |
| brand          | Brand of the product                |
| price          | Price of the product                |
| user_id        | Identifier for the user             |
| user_session   | Identifier for the user's session   |

#### Steps to Import
1. Ensure the database is running and the schema is applied.
2. Use the `/import-csv` endpoint to upload the CSV file.
   - Example cURL command:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/import-csv \
     -F "file=@path/to/your/csvfile.csv"
     ```
3. The application will process the file and populate the `products` and `events` tables.

## üåê API Endpoints

### Products
- **Add Product**: `POST /products`
- **Update Stock**: `PUT /products/{productId}/stock`
- **List Products**: `GET /products`
- **Get Product by ID**: `GET /products/{productId}`

### Carts
- **Add Item to Cart**: `POST /additem/{aggregateId}`

## üß™ Testing
Run the tests using:
```bash
./mvnw test
```

## üìä Performance Testing
Use the Kaggle cosmetics dataset to simulate real-world scenarios and measure performance.

## üîç Monitoring

The application includes monitoring capabilities using Spring Boot Actuator. Actuator provides various endpoints to monitor and manage the application.

### Enabling Actuator
1. Ensure the application is running.
2. Access the Actuator endpoints at `http://localhost:8080/actuator`.

### Key Endpoints
- `/actuator/health`: Check the health status of the application.
- `/actuator/metrics`: View application metrics.
- `/actuator/httptrace`: Trace HTTP requests.

### Customization
You can customize the Actuator settings in `application.yml` under the `management` section.

## üñ•Ô∏è Swagger UI

The application includes Swagger UI for testing and exploring the REST API endpoints.

### Accessing Swagger UI
1. Start the application.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
3. Use the interface to test the available API endpoints.

### Example Endpoints
- **Add Product**: `POST /products`
- **Update Stock**: `PUT /products/{productId}/stock`
- **Add Item to Cart**: `POST /additem/{aggregateId}`

Swagger UI provides a user-friendly way to interact with the API without needing external tools like Postman.
